# GAN-uisng-Keras
This repository demonstrates how to develop Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using Keras. It includes steps for data preprocessing, constructing the generator and discriminator models, combining them to create the GAN, training the GAN, and evaluating its performance.

## Objectives

- Build, train, and evaluate GANs using Keras.
- Explore GAN architectures, data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

  ## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- TensorFlow (including Keras)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
